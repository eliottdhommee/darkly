in /?page=media&src=nsa
in the homepage there is an image of the nsa with a link
we can see that what we pass to src is passed as object data
we can put some code in the source but raw code doesn't work
we can pass this encoded in base64 to get the flag
<script>alert("Hello");</script>
http://192.168.56.101/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiSGVsbG8iKTs8L3NjcmlwdD4=

possible solution:
use a database for medias
parse end escape data sent by user
